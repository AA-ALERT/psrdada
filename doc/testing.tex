\chapter{Testing the DADA Software}
\label{app:software}

This chapter describes the various programs that have been designed to
facilitate testing and development of the DADA software

\section{Primary Write Client Demonstration, {\tt dada_pwc_demo}}

The Primary Write Client (PWC) Demonstration program, {\tt
dada_pwc_demo}, implements an example PWC interface.  It does not
actually acquire any data and therefore can be run on any computer.
This program has two modes of operation: free and locked.

In {\em free} mode, {\tt dada_pwc_demo} does not connect to the Header
and Data Blocks; therefore, it is not necessary to create the shared
memory resources and run a Primary Read Client program.  This mode is
most useful when testing the command interface and state machine of
the Primary Write Client.  To run in {\em free} mode, simply type
\begin{verbatim}
dada_pwc_demo
\end{verbatim}

In {\em locked} mode, {\tt dada_pwc_demo} connects to the Header
and Data Blocks; therefore, it is necessary to first create the shared
memory resources and also run a Primary Read Client program, such
as {\tt dada_dbdisk}.  This mode is most useful when testing the
interface between Primary Write Client, Header and Data Blocks, and
Primary Read Client software.  To run in {\em locked} mode, for example
\begin{verbatim}
dada_db            # create the shared memory resources
dada_pwc_demo -l   # run in locked mode
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
