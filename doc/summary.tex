Name & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Function} & Machine \\ \hline

{\tt dma2db} & Transfers data from EDT buffers to the Data Block.
	& Primary \\

{\tt db2disk} & Reads data from the Data Block and writes it, with
	header information, to disk. & Both \\

{\tt db2nic} & Reads data from the Data Block and sends it, with
	header information, to a Secondary node. & Primary \\

{\tt nic2db} & Receives data from Primary node and writes it to the 
	Data Block. & Secondary \\

{\tt dspsr} & Attaches to the Data Block and processes raw data
	according to specification, writing results to disk. &
	Secondary \\

{\tt puma2} & Connects to the Command and Control interface of the
	various Primary nodes.  Accepts and maintains external
	text-based control connection.  & fixed \\

{\tt puma2tms} & Translates TMS control structure packets into
	text-based commands as accepted by {\tt puma2} control
	connection. & fixed \\

{\tt puma2tui} & Textual user interface connects to {\tt puma2},
	displays various quantities of interest, and controls
	the instrument. & variable \\

{\tt puma2skd} & High-level code that schedules and records
        data reduction operations & fixed \\
