\begin{abstract}
This document specifies the software element of the 2nd generation of
the Dutch Pulsar Machine, PuMa-II, to be installed at the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope, WSRT, in 2005.  PuMa-II will consist of
eight data acquisition machines, called the \emph{primary units}, and
a processing cluster of \emph{secondary units}.

Each primary unit will interface with one of the 20\, MHz, 12-bit
sampled outputs of the WSRT tied-array beam former.  On each machine,
a custom-designed interface card (PiC) will re-sample the data with
8-bit resolution and write the data to computer RAM via a direct
memory access (DMA) interface.  A large file storage facility,
implemented using hardware RAID controllers, will be used to store
data locally, and a high-speed interconnect will enable the data to be
sent to secondary nodes for data reduction.

The communications plan and protocol used for sending the data from
primary to secondary node may change over the life of the PuMa-II
instrument.  Therefore, an adaptable and modular design philosophy has
been employed in software at every level of communications, command,
and control.  This document contains an overview of the software
model, including a discussion of the design decisions made, and
followed by a description of the requirements of each element.
